# Arduino-Eggs-Sorter-By-Index
This program sorts eggs by their freshness with LDR sensor with the less light go through the fresher the eggs get. Code is programmed using modified binarySearch (nlogn) and quicksort (library nlogn) of n=5. I made this for a school project. Shoutout to KickSort for making my life easier.

Using only a single arduino, one super light LED, and LDR sensor
